    Stores information about the character in this particular
    fight - where they're standing (rank), how they might be
    attacking (weapon and combat_style).
    Properties to know:
    self.char - the character we're wrapped around
    self.weapon - the character's weapon if it exists
    self.shield - our shield if it exists
    self.initiative - current initiative roll
    self.status - "active" means they can fight
    self.afk_timer - time set when we were marked AFK
    self.votes_to_kick - how many people have voted us AFK
    self.lost_turn_counter - how many turns we have to sit idle
    self.blocker_list - people stopping us from fleeing
    self.block_flee - anyone we're stopping from fleeing
    self.covering_targs - who we're helping flee
    self.covered_by - people who are helping us flee
    
    Stuff about how we attack:
    self.can_be_blocked, self.can_be_dodged, self.can_be_parried - all about our attack type
    opposites are self.can_block, self.can_dodge, self.can_parry.
    self.riposte - determines whether we can hit someone who botches
    self.stance - "defensive" to "reckless". gives attack/defense mods
    
    CharacterCombatData has the following methods:
    roll_initiative() - sets initiative and a tiebreaker value for the character
    roll_attack(targ, penalty=0) - targ is a CharacterCombatData object, returns self.char's to-hit roll
    roll_defense(att, weapon=None, penalty=0) - att is a CharacterCombatData, returns self.char's defense roll
    roll_damage(targ, penalty=0) - returns self.char's damage roll
    roll_mitigation(att, weapon=None, roll=0) - returns self.char's mitigation roll
    roll_flee_success() - returns True or False, whether we succeed in fleeing

        Character attempts to flee from combat. If successful, they are

        unlimited travel system we have out of combat in Arx, we want to
        restrict movement immediately at the start of combat, as otherwise
        simply leaving is trivial. Currently we don't support combat with
        characters in other spaces, and require a new combat to start every
        time you chase someone down in some extended chase scene. This may
        not be the best implementation, but it's what we're going with for
        now.
        Flee works by flagging the character as attempting to flee. They're
        added to an attempting to flee list. If someone stops them, they're
        removed from the list. Executing the command when already in the
        list will complete it successfully.
