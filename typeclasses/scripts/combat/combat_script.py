"""
Combat Manager. This is where the magic happens. And by magic,
we mean characters dying, most likely due to vile sorcery.

The Combat Manager is invoked by a character starting combat
with the +fight command. Anyone set up as a defender of either
of those two characters is pulled into combat automatically.
Otherwise, players can enter into combat that is in progress
with the appropriate defend command, or by a +fight command
to attack one of the belligerent parties.

Turn based combat has the obvious drawback that someone who
is AFK or deliberately not taking their turn completely halts
the action. There isn't an easy solution to this. GMs will
have tools to skip someone's turn or remove them from combat,
and a majority vote by all parties can cause a turn to proceed
even when someone has not taken their turn.

Phase 1 is the setup phase. This phase is designed to have a
pause before deciding actions so that other people can join
combat. Characters who join in later phases will not receive
a combat turn, and will be added to the fight in the following
turn. Phase 1 is also when players can vote to end the combat.
Every player MUST enter a command to continue for combat to
proceed. There will never be a case where a character can be
AFK and in combat. It is possible to vote a character out of
combat due to AFK in order for things to proceed. Immediately
after every current combatant selects to continue, the participants
are locked in and we go to phase 2.

Phase 2 is the action phase. Initiative is rolled, and then
each player must take an action when it is their turn. 'pass'
is a valid action. Each combat action is resolved during the
character's turn. Characters who are incapacitated lose their
action. Characters who join combat during Phase 2 must wait
for the following turn to be allowed a legal action.

    Players are added via add_combatant or add_observer. These are invoked
    by commands in normal commandsets. Characters added receive the combat
    commandset, which give commands that invoke the other methods.
    
    Turns proceed based on every combatant submitting an action, which is a
    dictionary of combatant IDs to their actions. Dead characters are moved
    to observer status, incapacitated characters are moved to a special
    list to denote that they're still in combat but can take no action.

    location under room.ndb.combat_manager, and inside each character in the
    combat under character.ndb.combat_manager.
    Note that all the data for the combat manager is stored inside non-database
    attributes, since it is designed to be non-persistent. If there's a server
    reset, combat will end.

    self.ndb.combat_location - room where script happens
