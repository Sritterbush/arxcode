    @check

    Usage:
      @check <stat>[+<skill>][ at <difficulty number>][=receivers]

    Performs a stat/skill check for your character, generally to
    determine success in an attempted action. For example, if you
    tell a GM you want to climb up the wall of a castle, they might
    tell you to check your 'check dex + athletics, difficulty 30'.
    You would then '@check dexterity+athletics at 30'. You can also
    specify checks only to specific receivers. For example, if you
    are attempting to lie to someone in a whispered conversation,
    you might '@check charm+manipulation=Bob' for lying to Bob at
    the default difficulty of 15.

    The dice roll system has a stronger emphasis on skills than
    stats. A character attempting something that they have a skill
    of 0 in may find the task very difficult while someone with a
    skill of 2 may find it relatively easy.
